# Movie Trailer Website (React)

I'm enrolled in UDACITY's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004). Among other things, I'm also interested in learning [React](https://reactjs.net/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

After I finished the first the project of the Nanodegree, Movie Trailer Website, I decided to take a shot at implementing it with [React](https://reactjs.net/) and deploying it to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) as a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) application.

Here's the result. [Movie Trailer Website React](https://movie-trailer-website-react.herokuapp.com/) `(If it's a little slow starting up just give it a few seconds, the app might need to wake up if it hasn't been run in a while.)`

If you want to create your own React application and run it on Heroku you use this excellent project I found:

### [React + Node Starter](https://github.com/alanbsmith/react-node-example)

as a starting place.

If you want to try out this project, keep reading.

How to run
----------
* Clone the repository

* Install the dependencies
* `$ npm install`

* Run the development server:
* `$ npm run dev`

Once the server is running, you can visit `http://localhost:8080/`

A few more details...

This application is _not_ a [Universal JavaScript](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9) application. It's a simple [Express](https://expressjs.com/) webserver that serves up ['transpiled'](https://babeljs.io/) JavaScript. If you're interested in Universal React applications you can check out this project, [React Redux Universal Hot Example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example).
